# Music Release
A Simple Music release manager for my site https://rolandoramostorres.com 

# Installation
* Download, install and activate the [latest release](https://github.com/rolodoom/music_release/releases)
* Install and activate [ACF plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
* Download and import [music_release-acf.json ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rolodoom/music_release/main/assets/acf/music_release-acf.json)


## Why Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) ?
This plugin requires Advanced Custom Fields plugin to be installed in order to work. It's just easy for me this way 'cause I'm just learning to code wp plugins and still don't know how to make custom fields inmy plugin and it's on the TODO list.


# TODO List
* Not depend on ACF
